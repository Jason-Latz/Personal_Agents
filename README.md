# Personal_Agents

I'm trying to experiment with projects exploring agentic AI with Pydantic models and simple MCP server interactions!

## Projects
- **pydantic_agent** – Toy agent using Pydantic for typed messages.
- **mcp_client** – WebSocket client for connecting to MCP servers.
- **multi_agent_system** – Minimal multi-agent demo using threads.
- **nvidia_langchain_agent** – Contest-ready agent using LangChain and NVIDIA LLMs.

## Setup
Install Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Each project may have additional requirements. See their respective folders for details.
